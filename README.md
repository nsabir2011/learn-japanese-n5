# Japanese Kana Sprint

Three offline, adaptive reading trainers and one guided language-learning experience:

- **Hiragana Sprint** — hiragana characters, combinations, beginner words, and Japanese numbers.
- **Katakana Sprint** — katakana characters, practical combinations, and beginner words.
- **Kana Mix** — interleaved hiragana and katakana practice, plus the shared Japanese-number course.
- **Guided Lessons** — mission-based conversation, grammar, listening, sentence production, and delayed review.

All three trainers share the same interface and learning system. Hiragana and Katakana keep their own mastery records; Kana Mix reads and updates both sets.

## Start practicing

No installation or web server is needed. Open `index.html` for the activity launcher, or open any trainer directly in a modern browser:

- `index.html`
- `hiragana_sprint.html`
- `katakana_sprint.html`
- `kana_sprint.html`
- `guided/player.html?lesson=1`
- `guided/player.html?lesson=2`

The root launcher links directly to each guided lesson. The lesson query selects the curriculum loaded by the reusable guided player.

Keep the repository folders together. The standalone pages load their scripts, lesson content, fonts, and assets through relative paths.

### Test the Sites build locally

The Sites build requires Node.js 22.13 or newer. Install dependencies and start the development server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

The development command prepares the static trainer assets, applies any pending migrations to the project-local D1 database, and starts the site at `http://localhost:3000/`. The Sites development server signs the browser in as a stable simulated user so two browsers can exercise the same cloud-progress record. Local D1 data remains under the ignored `.wrangler` directory.

## Practice modes

### Learn

Introduces rows gradually. A completely new kana first appears in standard print with its reading and full mnemonic; this study step changes neither mastery, accuracy, nor streak. An unaided check follows after several intervening questions. Weak kana return more often, while successful unaided practice unlocks later rows. Rehearsal can also unlock a row when you demonstrate that you already know every kana in it.

The introduction card pairs the standard kana with its sourced visual and a prefilled alternative text hook. It is a study step, so the next encounter—not the introduction itself—tests recall.

### Rehearse

Lets you select any rows immediately. An assessment means a graded recall attempt rather than merely viewing a mnemonic. While unassessed kana remain, the trainer favors coverage so the last few unseen kana do not get starved by reviews. A kana's first successful assessment uses standard print; varied fonts become eligible after that unaided recognition. Once the selected set has been fully assessed, practice becomes fully adaptive.

Recent mistakes increase the share of difficult sound categories, including voiced, semi-voiced, and combination kana. Mistake reviews are delayed enough to test recall instead of immediate repetition.

Learn and Rehearse offer the brief typing-retry button only when an initial wrong answer differs from the expected reading by exactly one adjacent QWERTY key and is not itself another valid kana reading. For example, `kp` for `ko` can trigger Retry, while `ki` for `ko` remains a normal learning mistake. This constant-time check runs only after an incorrect kana submission; Word mode keeps its existing behavior.

In Kana Mix, the Script balance panel offers adaptive, even, focused, and custom Hiragana/Katakana ratios. Adaptive balance favors the weaker script while continuing to practise both.

### Words

Practises whole words in romaji. Every revealed answer includes the English meaning and a complete kana-to-romaji spelling guide. The guide separates each sound block and explains applicable rules such as small `っ / ッ` consonant doubling, long vowels, Katakana `ー`, combined sounds such as `きょ / キョ`, and `ん / ン`. If a word cannot be decomposed safely, it shows the exact practice spelling instead of guessing. Press Enter again to continue.

After the answer is revealed, the guide shows how each kana block contributes to the required spelling and explains every special typing rule used by that word.

Word rescue accepts typing plus Enter, mouse selection, or number keys **1–8**. After two incorrect rescue attempts, the complete spelling guide appears while the rescue choices remain available. The word scheduler mixes new vocabulary with adaptive review and increases features that have caused recent trouble.

If Japanese speech is available in the browser, the trainer can pronounce the word and optionally its English meaning. **Settings & Data → Speech & voices** reports whether suitable voices were found and includes test buttons. Voice selection is shared with Vocabulary and Numbers, while playback options are saved locally. An optional setting lets the current pronunciation finish after Enter moves to the next word.

### Vocabulary

The dedicated **Vocabulary** page practises Japanese reading, listening, and English-to-Japanese recall separately from kana word reading. New expressions are taught with their Japanese form, romaji, English meaning, and pronunciation before the first graded question. Answers adapt from four to six and then eight choices as mastery in the tested direction grows; number keys **1–8** are supported. Distractors favor useful semantic, spelling, and sound contrasts, rotate over time, and remember the learner's previous confusions. Ambiguous expressions also appear in short situational prompts.

The curriculum covers the complete vocabulary lists and useful expressions from Genki Lesson 1 and Lesson 2: greetings, school and personal information, countries, majors, occupations, family, time, demonstratives, places, food, belongings, prices, and shopping language. Practical-extras stages preserve the app’s existing everyday vocabulary and add high-frequency comprehension, routine, food, transport, and direction words. In the Guided course, a later stage opens permanently only after every expression in the current stage has been introduced, attempted, and the stage reaches 35% average mastery. The saved pace control changes how quickly new expressions appear without skipping this order. Reading, listening, recall, and mixed formats use the universal voice selected in **Settings & Data** when speech is needed.

Vocabulary mastery is tracked independently for reading, listening, and recall, while a word is introduced only once across every direction. Words introduced through a focused filter remain available to the Guided course for review; they are never taught as new a second time. Recent-performance windows and question-count spacing make the review queue react to current weakness, while a focused trouble-word mode is available from the page. Practice can be scoped to the Guided course, All vocabulary (Lessons 1–2 plus Practical extras), Core lessons (Lessons 1–2 without extras), an individual lesson, Practical extras, or trouble words. The top dashboard shows scope, session accuracy, reviews due, mastered words, and current choice difficulty.

### Numbers

The dedicated **Numbers** page begins with 0–10, then covers teens, tens, hundreds, thousands, irregular readings such as `sanbyaku`, `roppyaku`, `happyaku`, `sanzen`, and `hassen`, and the Japanese 10,000 unit `man`.

New number patterns are explained before the first graded question. Practice can run from digits to a romaji reading, from a hiragana reading to digits, or in both directions. Correct and corrected answers show the number, kanji, hiragana, romaji, and a component-by-component breakdown. Japanese speech uses the voice selected in Word mode when available.

The number scheduler tracks patterns rather than memorizing individual generated numbers. Weak patterns return more often, the pace slider controls new-pattern frequency, recent numbers are avoided, likely one-character or transposed-letter typing errors receive one ungraded retry, and mistakes open four keyboard-accessible rescue choices. Number progress has its own import, export, and reset controls.

### Guided lessons

`index.html` presents the available guided lessons. Lesson 1 turns beginner vocabulary and grammar into a cumulative first-conversation journey with eight stages organized by learning purpose rather than textbook page order: situational greetings; introductions; useful school, work, nationality, and major vocabulary; questions; natural names and titles; noun relationships with `の`; family, age, time, and telephone details; and a mixed conversation mission.

Lesson 2 follows a visual day-out journey. Its ten stages change viewpoints while teaching `これ／それ／あれ`, attach nouns with `この／その／あの`, build and hear prices, complete a flea-market purchase, locate places, return lost property, distinguish `ね` from `よ`, order lunch, use classroom repair phrases, and finish with linked conversation missions.

Each idea moves from a concise model to retrieval through situational choices, audio-only comprehension, sentence construction, error repair, typed numeric details, and a mixed checkpoint. Expandable examples explain both the full sentence meaning and each meaningful piece. Practice draws from curated concept families across settings such as orientation, clubs, dorms, libraries, and language exchanges; recent families, prompt variants, and scenarios are temporarily excluded. A delayed recovery changes both the example and its setting when another suitable scenario is available. Checkpoints sample distinct concept families for broader transfer. Correct recall expands the next review interval from minutes to days and weeks; a lapse schedules a near-term related example without immediately repeating the same prompt.

Audio has an explicit assessment role. Listening comprehension and numeric dictation play it as the prompt; sentence construction, grammar, and error repair make pronunciation available only after the learner submits an answer.

General number construction stays on the focused Numbers page. Guided Lesson 1 links to that foundation and teaches only the contextual forms needed for ages, school years, telephone digits, and time. Japanese pronunciation reads the universal voice and speed saved in **Settings & Data**.

### Learning pace

Learn, Rehearse, and Words each have a saved pace control. Learn adjusts how often a not-yet-introduced kana and mnemonic appear within unlocked rows, Rehearse adjusts assessment coverage of the selected set, and Words adjusts new vocabulary frequency from review-heavy to new-first. Vocabulary reviews that are due take priority; otherwise its pace is applied as a stable new-word proportion, with **New-first** choosing new material whenever no review is due. A pace control stops affecting selection once its current pool is fully introduced or assessed.

After the P-row reaches 72 average mastery and combination rows become available, Learn automatically uses one pace step faster without changing the saved slider setting. If the slider is already at **New-first**, Combo sprint keeps new kana first and accelerates combination-row unlocking: every combination must be introduced and attempted unaided, at least two thirds must be recalled correctly, and recent row accuracy must reach 72%. Weak combinations remain in adaptive review after the next row unlocks.

### Fonts

Standard print is always enabled. Additional handwriting-style fonts can be selected for all kana practice modes from the expandable **Practice fonts** manager in **Trainer Settings**. Harder fonts award slightly more mastery for a correct first attempt.

When a difficult-font answer is wrong, the standard form appears beside it for one more attempt. The correction identifies the font and links directly to its highlighted entry in the font manager. Rescue choices appear only if that comparison attempt is also wrong.

### Mnemonics

Learn and Rehearse include an optional **Need a mnemonic?** hint for individual kana. When local chart crops are present, the first click shows a visual-only card. A visual-assisted correct answer receives 40% of normal mastery in standard print or 25% when the mnemonic also supplies the standard form for a difficult-font question. A second click reveals the full answer mnemonic and awards no mastery. Assisted recognitions do not affect accuracy or streak. Introductions, assisted recognitions, and rescue corrections schedule guaranteed unaided checks after several intervening questions. If two rescue attempts are incorrect, one visual mnemonic hint appears automatically; the built-in mnemonic is used when local artwork is unavailable.

Exposure and assessment are tracked separately. Seeing a difficult font still increases its exposure count, but font accuracy uses only unaided graded attempts. Kana Progress shows a simple assisted-recognition total.

During the first Learn/Rehearse visual hint, Tofugu cards use a local CSS blur cover over their repeated Latin badge (with a wider cover for `HU / FU`). Full answer mnemonics, rescue corrections, and the Mnemonics tab remain unmasked.

The **Mnemonics** tab separates two memory aids that may tell different stories: sourced visual artwork and a prefilled alternative text mnemonic. Artwork includes an information control with its title, credit, rights note, and original source link. You can edit any text mnemonic, restore its built-in version, and filter the list to weak, mistaken, assisted, or customized kana. Voiced kana and combinations derive their text mnemonic from the base form and sound marks. Custom text and hint statistics are included in automatic saves and exported progress. If local artwork is absent, every hint falls back to the text mnemonic.

### Local mnemonic artwork

The supplied Tofugu charts are third-party artwork. The originals live locally under `assets/local-mnemonics/sources/tofugu/`, while generated crops belong under `assets/local-mnemonics/tofugu/`; the generated crops are committed for this private, offline-ready repository, while the originals remain ignored. Keep the repository private unless you have redistribution permission. To regenerate them, run `scripts/crop_tofugu_mnemonics.py` with the two source paths and (optionally) `--output assets/local-mnemonics/tofugu`. The utility validates the 3300×2550 source size, the 46-panel Hiragana/Katakana layouts, duplicate/missing assignments, and writes a manifest with the crop coordinates. The application code and mapping remain usable without the original source files.

The separate user-supplied LeafPiece original is kept locally under `assets/local-mnemonics/sources/leafpiece/`, and its generated cards under `assets/local-mnemonics/leafpiece/`. The selected Pictografix original and generated panels follow the same pattern under `sources/pictografix/` and `pictografix/`. LeafPiece visual hints retain the complete card and use deterministic white caption masks (recorded in its local manifest); the full crops remain untouched for answer-stage mnemonics. The selected alternatives are indexed in `features/kana/mnemonic-preferences.json` and are the active artwork for the trainer; when a kana has multiple retained picks, the latest option is shown. The JavaScript bridge keeps this working when the launchers are opened directly through `file://`. The runtime source registry mirrors the provenance entries needed by the information dialog; the canonical source URLs, artwork credits, and rights notes remain recorded in `docs/mnemonic-artwork-sources.md`.

### Progress

The two grouped **Progress** tabs in each kana trainer show kana mastery, weak items, common confusions, font recognition, curriculum status, and word-reading statistics. Vocabulary and Numbers show their own progress beside their focused practice surfaces.

The top streak box follows the active kana practice mode: Kana in Learn and Rehearse, and Words in Word mode. Vocabulary and Numbers keep independent streaks on their own pages, so a mistake in one activity does not reset the others. The kana highlight begins with gentle rewards at 5 and 15, then becomes more prominent at 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, and 200 consecutive correct answers. The 200+ tier uses the legendary purple-gold style.

## Answering questions

- Type the romaji reading and press **Enter**.
- After a correct word or vocabulary choice, press **Enter** again to move on.
- After a typed wrong answer, **Typing mistake? Retry** is available for three seconds. Click it or press **Esc** to restore the same prompt and original font. On difficult-font questions, the standard reference stays blurred until this window expires. The first result remains recorded, and the retry is offered only once for that question.
- In Learn and Rehearse, the retry appears only when the answer looks like a likely keyboard typo: one adjacent-key substitution (such as `kp` for `ko`) or one pair of neighboring letters entered in reverse order (such as `hsa` for `sha` or `ot` for `to`). A typed answer that is itself another valid kana reading remains a normal learning mistake. Word mode keeps its general retry behavior.
- If rescue choices appear, type the reading and press **Enter**, click one, or press **1–8**. Word rescues also accept typed readings; the automatic two-mistake mnemonic applies to kana practice.
- Use **I don't know** when you cannot recall the answer.

Typing speed is diagnostic only. A slow correct answer does not reduce mastery, and returning after an inactivity gap is not treated as a slow response.

## Saving progress

Progress is automatically saved after answers and setting changes using the browser's local storage:

- Hiragana key: `hiragana-sprint-v3`
- Katakana key: `katakana-sprint-v1`
- Kana Mix settings key: `kana-sprint-mix-v1`
- Shared number-learning key: `kanaSprintNumbersV1`
- Shared vocabulary-learning key: `kanaSprintVocabularyV1`
- Guided-lessons key: `kanaSprintGuidedLessonsV1`

Kana Mix merges the two script records when it opens. Every mixed answer is then written back to the appropriate Hiragana or Katakana record, so practising in Kana Mix also updates the corresponding individual trainer.

This data belongs to that browser and computer. It is **not** saved as a file in this project folder. Clearing browser data, using another browser, or changing how the files are opened can make the saved progress unavailable.

When the app is run through its Sites build, the same records remain in local storage for immediate startup and offline use, and are also synchronized to D1 for the signed-in user. D1 assigns an increasing revision to each accepted update. A device sends the revision it last received; if another device has already advanced it, the server merges independently updated learning items before issuing the next revision. Local changes that cannot be uploaded remain queued and retry after reconnection.

The hosted origin cannot automatically read progress belonging to a `file://` page or another origin. To migrate existing progress, export a complete backup from the old copy and import it into the hosted copy. The imported local-storage updates are then queued for D1 automatically.

For a portable backup, open **Settings & Data** and select **Export all progress**. The complete backup includes every available Hiragana, Katakana, Kana Mix, word, vocabulary, number, guided-lesson, mnemonic, font, voice, and app-settings record. Importing first shows a dated summary and only restores the listed areas after confirmation.

Older trainer-specific and number-only backup files remain supported under **Advanced component backups**.

It is a good idea to export a backup occasionally.

## Speech support

Pronunciation uses the browser's built-in Web Speech API and does not require an API key. Availability depends on the browser, operating system, and installed voices.

- A local Japanese voice should work offline.
- Some voices may require an internet connection.
- If no Japanese voice is found, install a Japanese speech voice in the operating system and reopen the trainer.

The launchers deliberately use ordinary deferred scripts rather than JavaScript modules, so they continue to work when opened directly through `file://`.

## Resetting or transferring progress

- To move all progress to another computer or browser, use the complete backup in **Settings & Data**.
- Use **Advanced component backups** when you only want the current trainer or number history.
- **Reset current trainer**, **Reset numbers**, and **Reset all app data** are kept separate so the affected data is clear.
- Resetting the current trainer from Kana Mix resets its linked Hiragana and Katakana progress as well.

## Font licences

Bundled practice fonts come from the Google Fonts project. Their licence files are included in the `fonts` folder.
